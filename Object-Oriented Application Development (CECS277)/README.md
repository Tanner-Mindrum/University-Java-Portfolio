# Course Overview
This course is the second semester focused on Java programming, which takes a closer look at the more complex topics and concepts associated with Java.

Course Content:<br />
Developing applications using disciplined methods of design, coding, and testing in Java. Topics include: the structure and semantics of Java classes, data abstraction, encapsulation, cohesion, coupling, information hiding, object-oriented design, inheritance, interfaces, composition, delegation, polymorphism, and design patterns.

Course Goals:<br />
-Design an abstract class and an appropriate set of instantiable child classes to solve a software requirement<br />
-Effectively use inheritance, interfaces, composition and delegation<br />
-Effectively use Java Collections library<br />
-Effectively use design patterns to create software<br />
-Effectively use try/catch/throw along with the Java Error Exception class hierarchy<br />
-Design a class hierarchy of medium complexity (6-12 classes) to create a software solution for a non-trivial application<br />
-Implement their class hierarchy to produce the software solution<br />
-Provide unit tests<br />

Projects Completed:<br />
1. WAR! (Classic card game)<br />
2. Boba shop ordering software<br />
3. Boba shop ordering software (cont. with GUI)<br />
4. Prototype design pattern research<br />
5. "Party World!" front-desk reservation system (application of design patterns)
